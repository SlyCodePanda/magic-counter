## Magic: The Gathering Life Counter
The idea for this project is to create a nice and simple counter for a game of Magic: The Gathering.

### Base Features
* Ability to change the names of the created players.
* Have  + and - buttons for adding and subtracting life points.

### Possible Additional Features
* Be able to change settings for the amount of life points players start on.
* Change colour of Player counter areas based on set colour used (Red, Blue, Green, Black, White).

### To Use
Download files and run:
```
python app.py
```
in the command line in the directory of where the files are downloaded.

### Software To Use
<b>Programming language</b> : Python 3<br>
<b>UI</b> : PyQt 5 & Qt Designer

I plan on building a more advanced version in the future with more features such allowing for more than two players.
